		<h1>Welcome to the Memory Card Game</h1>
		<p>An engaging, fun game designed to challenge your memory and concentration skills. This two-player online game allows players to take turns flipping cards and matching pairs of images. The game continues until all pairs are found, and the player with the most card matches wins!</p>
		
		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Setup:</strong> The game starts with a shuffled deck of cards laid out face-down. Each card has a matching pair.</li>
			<li><strong>Turns:</strong> Players take turns to flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they remain face-up, and the player earns a point. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back face-down, and the turn passes to the other player.</li>
			<li><strong>Winning:</strong> The game continues until all cards are matched. The player with the most matched pairs wins the game.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Real-time Multiplayer: Play with a friend in real-time. Each player can connect to the game through their browser, and actions are synchronized using WebSockets.</li>
			<li>Player Information: The game displays each player's score and indicates whose turn it is, ensuring both players are always informed.</li>
			<li>Visual Feedback: Cards are visually flipped and matched with smooth animations, making the game visually appealing.</li>
			<li>Restart Option: Players can restart the game to play again.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Technical Details</h2>

			<li>Frontend: The game's interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes dynamic elements like score updates and turn indicators.</li>
			<li>Backend: The backend server is implemented using Node.js and the ws library. It handles player connections, game state management, and broadcasts updates to all connected clients.</li>
			<li>Shuffle Algorithm: The cards are shuffled using a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure a random and fair distribution of card positions.</li>
		</ul>
